# MNIST
Neural Network Model AI using a 28x28 grid format to recognize hand-drawn numbers from 0-9

# Unfortunately
I wasent able to provide the source data I used for the training of the AI, it can be found and downloaded at the Kaggle website.
The Model takes minimal time to train but can be further improved upon in the future
